# RED

RED is a set of ruby scripts that takes beautiful .toml files and
converts them in all the crappy formats (.opr, .ctl) needed by ESP-r
models. 

RED stands for Ruby ESP-r Destroyer. It is also red ad in rage and
blood. That's what 3 all nighters of ESP-r simulation will do to you. 
But RED is also red as in love. ESP-r is ugly, but it is a truly powerful tool.

# TODO
- ~~sample .opr toml specification~~
- .opr.toml -> .opr conversion
- .ctl toml specification
- .ctl.toml -> .ctl conversion
